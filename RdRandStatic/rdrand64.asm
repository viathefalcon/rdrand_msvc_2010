	; unsigned fixed point number (where the integer part is 0) and the
	; contents of RDX as the integer part of a 128-bit fixed point number
	; (where the fractional part is 0).
	;
	; Because the top and bottom 64 bits, respectively, of our would-be 128-bit
	; inputs will always be zero we need only multiply the other 64 bits of each,
	; to obtain the middle 128 bits of the product. Conveniently, we have
	; just the instruction for this..
	mul rdx

	; The 128-bit fixed point product (integer:fraction) is given in RDX:RAX,
	; and by discarding the latter, we effectively truncate, to give us a
	; number n, 0 <= n < (upper - lower); adding lower gives us n, lower <= n < upper
